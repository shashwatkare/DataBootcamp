## f. What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?

- Although the top 10 stations have changed a bit in different years, most of these top stations for starting a journey are inside Manhattan. 
- According to previous findings that most of the bikers are work commuters, we can also find that some popular citi bike station is close to piers. The NY Waterway is the third way for commuters from outside (for example, New Jersey) into Manhattan.

## g. What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey?

## h. What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey?

- Most of them are seen outside the Manhattan. This might be related to the local residence type. In other words, not many workers lives there, there is fewer tourist attraction, or commuters prefer other travel method based on local traffic or features.

## l. How does the average trip duration change by age?

- It's weird to find out > 90 participants are in a large portion. It might imply the poor accurancy in the age data.
- With increasing subsribers, we can see the participants with ages between 10 and 20 occupy the largest proportion in 2017. It might indicate the age data is more accurate in the subscriber data tha in the short-term customer data.
